abstract = { Extended reality (XR) collaboration enables collaboration between physical and virtual spaces. Recent XR collaboration studies have focused on sharing and understanding the overall situation of the objects of interest (OOIs) and its surrounding ambient objects (AOs) rather than simply recognizing the existence of OOI. The sharing of the overall situation is achieved using three-dimensional (3D) models that replicate objects existing in the physical workspace. There are two approaches for creating the models: pre-reconstruction and real-time reconstruction. The pre-reconstruction approach takes considerable time to create polygon meshes precisely, and the real-time reconstruction approach requires a considerable time to install numerous sensors to perform accurate 3D scanning. In addition, these approaches are difficult to be used on the collaboration in a location beyond the reconstructed space, making them impractical to an actual XR collaboration. The approach proposed in this study separates the objects that form the physical workspace into OOI and AO, models only the OOI as a polygon mesh in advance, and reconstructs the AO into a point cloud using light detection and ranging technology for collaboration. The reconstructed point cloud is shared with remote collaborators through WebRTC, a web-based peer-to-peer networking technology with low latency. Each remote collaborator collects the delivered point cloud to form a virtual space, so that they can intuitively understand the situation at a local site. Because our approach does not create polygon meshes for all objects existing at the local site, we can save time to prepare for collaboration. In addition, we can improve the practicality of XR collaboration by eliminating the need to install numerous sensors at the local site. We introduce a prototype and an example scenario to demonstrate the practicality of our approach.},
